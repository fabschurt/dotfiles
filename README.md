# .dotfiles

Here is my personal dotfile collection. For the moment, it’s quite modest and
`bash`-based (I will switch to `zsh` soon).

Nothing really special here, the main `.bashrc` just sources some partials
stored in user home’s `.dotfiles` directory&nbsp;:

* `.exports`&nbsp;: environment variable exports
* `.aliases`&nbsp;: various lazy aliases for Git, Docker, etc.
* `.functions`&nbsp;: some utility functions I can call from the prompt
* `.env`&nbsp;: everything else that is environment-specific
